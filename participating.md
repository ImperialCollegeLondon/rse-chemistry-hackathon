## During the event

We'll start with some scene setting on the topic at hand. Then we'll split into
different groups based on people's projects/interests. Members of the College
RSE team will be on hand to provide advice, sources of information, and
technical help throughout. The whole group will reconvene at regular intervals
to share updates and experiences.

We'll be using Microsoft Teams to run the session. Breakout rooms will
facilitate focused group work. Please be prepared to share your screen and talk
on camera to helpers from the RSE team and other participants.

## After the event

* If you created an issue [update it][issues] with the outcome of the workshop.
* Keep in touch with the Research Software Community at Imperial. [Join the
  mailing list][list] or [Slack group][slack].
