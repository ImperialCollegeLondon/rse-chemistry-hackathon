## Who is this event for?

Computational researchers at Imperial, with any level of experience or
expertise. Anybody with an interest in learning about reproducibility, be it
picking up new tools and techniques, sharing tips and tricks, or just after some
dedicated time to level-up a project.

This particular event is primarily being advertised within Chemistry to try and
tap into an existing coherent community and to try and raise awareness of the
activities of the RSE team. It is by no means meant to exclude participants from
other areas however, so please feel free to sign up. We hope to repeat this
format of event targeting other areas.

## Why the focus on reproducibility?

How to improve reproducibility in scientific practice remains a hot topic and
was highlighted as being of particular interest in our recent survey of the
College. Key challenges in this area were highlighted in a recent [Nature
article][nature] and there are a number of grass roots movements dedicated to
solutions (e.g. [Reprohack][], [ReproducibiliTea][], [The Turing
Way][turing-way], [Software Carpentry][]). We hope this workshop will provide a
valuable opportunity for the RSE team to share our expertise with the wider
community.

## How will the event work?

The hackathon will be a fully hands-on event so please be prepared with a
computer to work with. The system you use day to day is best. You're invited to
bring along a project to work on (as an individual or a group) during
event. This can be anything, from some scripts you have floating around for data
analysis, up to a piece of software developed long-term by your group. If you
don't have a particular project in mind then that's a problem. Come along
prepared to learn about your reproducibility topic of choice or to pitch in on a
group project. The aim is for all attendees to make concrete progress in
improving the reproducibility of their work, irrespective of their level of
expertise or maturity of their project.

We'll start with some scene setting on the topic at hand. Then we'll split into
different groups based on people's projects/interests. Members of the College
RSE team will be on hand to provide advice, sources of information, and
technical help throughout. The whole group will reconvene at regular intervals
to share updates and experiences.

We'll be using Microsoft Teams to run the session. Breakout rooms will
facilitate focused group work. Please be prepared to share your screen and talk
on camera to helpers from the RSE team and other participants.
